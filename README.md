## :dart: Overview

<p>
It is a dashboard application built during a frontend job test. It wasn't built so well because of time, it'd be better if I did it with more time.
</p>

<p>I should make some charts in the app, but I don't even know how to do it. Maybe in the future I try to do it</p>

<p>You can visit the app clicking <a href='https://cms-dashboard.vercel.app/'>here</a></p>
